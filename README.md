# Transferability_Black-Box_Attacks

This is the code of the paper: Zhao Ren, Jing Han, Nicholas Cummins, and Björn W. Schuller. "Enhancing Transferability of Black-Box Adversarial Attacks via Lifelong Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition Models." in Proc. INTERSPEECH, Shanghai, China, 2020, pp. 496-500. (http://www.interspeech2020.org/uploadfile/pdf/Mon-2-1-1.pdf)

The implementations of the three frameworks: multitask learning, transfer learning, and lifelong learning, are provided in this github repository.

## Folders 

demos-multitask/demos-cnn: the implementation of the multitask learning

demos-lifelong-transfer/demos-cnn: the implementation of the lifelong learning and transfer learning. 

The difference between lifelong learning and transfer learning is using EWC loss function (Equation (3) in the paper). 
If transfer learning, please remove the EWC loss function in the file demos-lifelong-transfer/demos-cnn/pytorch/main_pytorch.py 
If lifelong learning, please keep the EWC loss function in the same file  

## Feature Extraction

For each framework, please run command: python utils/features.py

## Train and Evaluation

For each framework, please run command: sh runme.sh
